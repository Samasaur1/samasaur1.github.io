At this point, Iâ€™m hosting a small fleet of systems, which are collectively hosting a fair amount of services.  These services all generate logs, which is great. However, all of this data is spread across machines and is inefficient to access or analyze, so I usually just ignored it. This is especially an issue when problems occur, because I can't always access the relevant data, nor is it always sufficient.

Enter [the Grafana/LGTM stack](https://grafana.com/oss/). This is a suite of open-source applications for collecting and visualizing analytics, metrics, and logs.
